# 2025-11-11 — Existing Episode S3 picker

## Highlights
- `/episodes/s3_videos` lists every `raw/videos/{ep_id}/episode.mp4` object with `ep_id`, size, last-modified, ETag, and whether it already exists in the local EpisodeStore.
- Streamlit’s Upload page now surfaces a “Existing Episode (browse S3)” panel so operators can pick any uploaded video, create the EpisodeStore record if needed, mirror it locally, and run detect/track immediately.

## Why it matters
Production uploads often land in S3 long before someone wants to run detect/track locally. The new picker removes the re-upload round trip and makes it obvious which episodes are already mirrored vs. still remote.

## How to use it
1. Open the Upload page and scroll to **Existing Episode (browse S3)**.
2. Filter/select an S3 video; click **Create episode in store** if it’s new.
3. Mirror from S3, adjust stride/FPS/device, and run detect/track directly.
