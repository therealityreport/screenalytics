# 2025-11-11 — Auto-detect FPS when running detect/track

## Highlights
- `tools/episode_run.py` now inspects the mirrored video with OpenCV and automatically uses its FPS whenever you pass `--fps 0` (the default in the UI when left blank). The detected FPS is logged and stored in the run summary/manifests.
- `/episodes/{ep_id}/video_meta` returns local video stats (fps, dimensions, duration) so the UI can display “Detected FPS: …” after mirroring.
- Upload & Run + Existing Episode panels show the detected FPS and offer a quick helper to apply it, making the auto mode explicit.

## Why it matters
Operators shouldn’t need to remember the source frame rate; auto-detecting it reduces mistakes when switching between 23.98/25/29.97 feeds and keeps manifests consistent for downstream metrics.

## How to use it
- Leave FPS at `0` (default) in the UI or CLI to use the detected value automatically.
- Hit the “Use detected FPS” helper button if you want to lock it in before running detect/track.
