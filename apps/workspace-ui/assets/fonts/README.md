# Custom fonts

Place the font files for Plymouth, Gloucester, and Rude in this folder using the following names:

- `Plymouth.ttf`
- `Gloucester.ttf`
- `Rude.ttf`

These are referenced by `apps/workspace-ui/ui_helpers.py` via `@font-face`. Once the files are added, Streamlit will load them automatically across the workspace UI.
