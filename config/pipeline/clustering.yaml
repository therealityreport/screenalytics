# Identity clustering configuration
# Controls how face tracks are grouped into identities

# Agglomerative clustering settings
cluster_thresh: 0.58  # Cosine similarity threshold (0.0-1.0, higher = stricter)
                      # Balanced: 0.58, Loose: 0.50, Strict: 0.70
                      # Converted to distance: dist = 1 - similarity

min_cluster_size: 1   # Minimum tracks per cluster (1 = allow singletons)
                      # Set higher to filter out brief appearances

# Outlier filtering
min_identity_sim: 0.50  # Minimum similarity to cluster centroid
                        # Tracks below this are ejected as outliers

# Track prototype selection
# (How to aggregate multiple face embeddings per track)
track_prototype:
  max_samples: 6        # Maximum face samples to use per track
  sim_delta: 0.08       # Similarity threshold for filtering bad samples

# Cluster metrics thresholds (for guardrails)
metrics_thresholds:

  max_cluster_count: 50           # Warn if > 50 identities (possible over-segmentation)

# Second-stage singleton merge (optional) for high-singleton runs

  fallback_delta: 0.05               # If similarity_thresh missing, use primary - delta
  neighbor_top_k: 20                 # Candidate neighbors per singleton (top-K by similarity)
  min_tracks_per_merged_cluster: 2   # Require at least this many tracks in a merged cluster
