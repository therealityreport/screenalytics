# DEPRECATED: Strict tracking config is now the DEFAULT
#
# This file is kept for backwards compatibility but is identical to
# config/pipeline/tracking.yaml (the default).
#
# For ULTRA-STRICT mode (embeddings every frame instead of every 5):
#   Use: ./scripts/detect_track_strict.sh <ep_id>
#
# Default tracking configuration for single-person tracks:

# ByteTrack spatial matching
track_thresh: 0.65      # Min confidence to track - filters low-quality detections
match_thresh: 0.85      # IoU threshold for bbox matching - tighter spatial matching
track_buffer: 15        # Frames to keep track alive - reduces incorrect associations
