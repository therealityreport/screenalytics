# Screen time analysis configuration
#
# This config controls how per-cast screen time is computed from assigned faces and tracks.

# Minimum face quality/confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
# Faces below this threshold are excluded from screen time calculations
quality_min: 0.7

# Gap tolerance in seconds
# Face detections within this gap are considered part of the same continuous appearance
gap_tolerance_s: 0.5

# Whether to use video decode for precise timestamps
# If false, falls back to frame_idx-based estimation
use_video_decode: true
