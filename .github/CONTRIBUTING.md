# Contributing

- Create a feature branch off `main`.
- Open a pull request early and keep it open while you push.
- Codex reviews PR diffs automatically. Address P0/P1 feedback before merge.
- Use conventional commit style in PR title (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`).
- If schema or embeddings change, include a migration note and rollback plan.
